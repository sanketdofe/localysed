## LOCALYSED : An area/locality recommender
Oct 2020 - Nov 2020

Housing is considered to be one of the three basic necessities. When a person is moving to a city or looking for a new locality to move to, he has to search through a large list.
Choosing a best-suited locality is still a complex and multidimensional concept. But, however, in its most narrow sense, it refers to best geographical area according to user’s requirements.
Whenever a person wants to choose a locality to move to, he/she prepares a huge list of preferences criteria for an ideal locality according to his/her preferences, and start searching for that ideal locality which is a very tedious and time-consuming task. The person ends up choosing a locality that satisfies some criteria while violating other according to his/her preferences. In the end, the sufferer is the user who ends up moving to a place which doesn’t satisfy his/her preferences.

## Solution
“LOCALYSED : A locality recommender” would like to focus on the aspects that are really necessary for the user according to him.
The objective of the project is to create a web application that helps a user to find a suitable region for accommodation in a city in a very interactive and hassle-free manner.
By asking a series of questions about preferences and living circumstances, we aim to recommend areas in a city on an interactive webmap showing perks of areas based on user’s preferences.

As this is a webapp, any user can access it from anywhere on the go and can use it at ease without any previous knowledge or training.
A user can get recommendations of various areas where he/she prefers to live in an easy manner by showing various colours to different block based on the user’s preferences.
Also, a user can apply various filters to change the importance to each aspect as compared to other aspects on which the valuation and colour of that block is assigned.
A user can see various places and their details like ‘Which restaurant is nearest and at how much distance approx.?’ and so on when he/she clicks on a particular block of interest.
A user is also able to add new places to the database via an interactive module of our webapp so that the ratings of the block that spatially contains it is adjusted and also the place can used to further recommend areas.

## Scope
The scope of the project is to serve the people willing to move to a new locality in the Mumbai, its Suburbs and Navi Mumbai Region only.
The goal of the project is to provide the user with a set of questions about preferences and living circumstances and then recommend blocks of regions of the preferred areas to the user.
